今生の景色に黙って櫛でとかしていた
揺らぐスープの向こう 伺う花ついばむ鳥へ
繋がれた横顔 無視されるなら傷つけて
ドアの外になおざりにされた傘よ 私は
類い稀な羽を持たされ
使わずして尚も愛を乞う
あなたの全能は私の幹でした

あなたの残り火を消せるのは私だけ

ほつれてく悲しいくらい確かな遺伝子よ
望んで欲しくて 引き出しの奥まるめたファクト
月灯りが照らす ガタついてる椅子さえも
その場しのぎの安らぎをくれるのに 私は
鍵穴から覗いた想空(そら)が
美しい季節並べても
私の明暗はあなたの声でした
でした ah
何度目かの冬が教えた
これ以上の愛はないだろう
あなたを最果てに連れていくのは私
私が私を抱きしめて 遅くはない
ゆっくり 愛を知る人になる

雲が残る合間 ただ太陽を見ていた
おざなりな僕ら 溢れだした声が
ただ大切な事は 伝わらないようにできてた
かたちのない色味を 抱きしめてみたの
期待と不安の日々を 後悔の味で知った
知らない世界へ 手を伸ばしたくて
強がりのウソなど ポケットにしまった
優しさを包む痛みも全部
覚えていたくて
ただ願って願って 生まれ変わっても
不確かな未来を謳っては触れたくて
伝って伝って 頬を流れる
その涙の味は いつかの約束
ただ灰になって 朧げになって
遠く何処かへ この夜を越えて蒼に染まる
夜もすがら夢を 張り巡らした想いを
見つからないまま 月は影を落とした
寝もやらず明けて 手も離せなくて
憧れる君を 遠ざけてしまった
あの日の僕の眼差しも全部
霞んでしまって
ただ痛くて痛くて 堪らない
空の青さは深く色を孕んでは冷たくて
伝って伝って 寄せ合う肩を
震わせた 微かな温もりを抱いては
まだ見ぬ世界へ 花は風を待って
遠く何処かへ この夜を越えて蒼に染まる
犯してきた過ちも その後悔さえも
かけがえのないものだから
ただ願って願って 生まれ変わっても

伝って伝って 頬を流れるその涙の味はいつかの約束

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!

You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

Made friends and lost them through the years

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it right
But I was younger then
Take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown

One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed

One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
